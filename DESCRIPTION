Title: Stagewise Generalized Estimating Equations
Version: 0.6-0
Date: 2018-01-08
Description: Stagewise techniques implemented with Generalized Estimating Equations to handle individual, group, bi-level, and interaction selection. Stagewise approaches start with an empty model and slowly build the model over several iterations, which yields a 'path' of candidate models from which model selection can be performed. This 'slow brewing' approach gives stagewise techniques a unique flexibility that allows simple incorporation of Generalized Estimating Equations; see Vaughan, G., Aseltine, R., Chen, K., Yan, J., (2017) <doi:10.1111/biom.12669> for details.
